# Single-Player-8-Ball-Pool
The project is a variation of 8 Ball Pool. The game is a one player version of pool in which the player must hit all of the balls in the pockets and then hit the black ball into any pocket to win. However, every turn there is a 1 in 8 chance that another ball is thrown onto the table. Also, if the player pockets the cue ball 3 more balls are placed on the board. The user can press/hold A &amp; D to aim clockwise and counterclockwise, press/hold W &amp; S to increase or decrease power, and press the spacebar to hit the ball. If the user pockets the cue ball, they can click on the table to place the cue ball back on the table.
